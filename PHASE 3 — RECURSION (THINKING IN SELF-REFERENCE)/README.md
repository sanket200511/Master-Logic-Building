# PHASE 3 — RECURSION (THINKING IN SELF-REFERENCE)

## Overview
This phase covers the fundamentals of recursion, a powerful technique where a function calls itself to solve problems. Recursion is key for solving problems that can be broken down into similar subproblems.

### Structure
- **Level 1:** Foundation of Recursion (Base + Recursive Case)
- **Level 2:** Number-based Recursive Thinking
- **Level 3:** Pattern & Printing Problems
- **Level 4:** String-based Recursion

### Key Details
- **Start Date:** March 28, 2026
- **Level 1 Completion Target:** April 2, 2026
- **Level 2 Completion Target:** April 7, 2026
- **Level 3 Completion Target:** April 12, 2026
- **Level 4 Completion Target:** April 17, 2026

### Tips
- Always define a clear base case.
- Visualize the recursive call stack.
- Practice tracing recursive calls for better understanding.
